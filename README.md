# penguinClassificationWithSklearn
There are 3 different species of penguins in this dataset, collected from 3 islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica. The goal of this project is to classify them using some characateristics given in the dataset provided by  Dr. Kristen Gorman 

In this machine learning model I used the sklearn library with MLPClassifier function which allow us to craete neural networks and train them, for this problem I split the data in 80% training and 20% testing, using 15000 epochs and 2 features of the dataset (Bill lenght and Flipper lenght) I was able to get around 76% accuracy in predicting the specie.
